Allow polygons with CLEARLINEFLAG set to cut out other polygons

Gives the possibility to mask out regions which are to be free of
polygon fill.

**** BUG: I think we need to stop exporter HIDs printing the ANTI polygons! *****
**** BUG: Anti-polygons do not re-clip polygons when they are moved to a new layer *****
