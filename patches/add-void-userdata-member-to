Add void *userdata member to the POLYAREA object

This is intended to allow client code operating on polygons to assign
arbitrary additional data to the polygon contours.

The initial target use-case is in 3D export code, where it is helpful to
have temporary links between POLYAREA contours being extruded and the 3D
object structures being generated. Allowing this tagging directly avoids
the need to maintain a hash-mapping or similar.
