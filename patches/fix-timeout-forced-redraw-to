Fix timeout forced redraw to run from the main loop, not directly

This avoids us drawing when the board is in an intermediate state. Will
likely not give as much immediacy as drawing from where the graphics are
invalidated - but avoids visual artaefacts when drawing tracks with
auto-enforce DRC enabled.
