Fix labeling of contour which ends up as all SHARED / SHARED2, or all UNKNKWN

SHARED / SHARED2 labelling does not propagate, so if this occurs for an entire
contour, the labelling code would loop forever. (Same as if no cross-connected
vertex with definitive INSIDE / OUTSIDE information was found).

Catch when we wrap around the edge list and then decide how to classify the
whole contour. If it is all UNKNWN, we re-classify it as not intersected. The
cntr_label_POLYAREA() routine is adjusted to handle the possibility that the
label_contour() routine for ISECTED contours changes the contour status back
back to UNKNWN.

If the whole contour is SHARED or SHARED2, we leave it as ISECTED, since there
is no handling of that condition for an entire contour. (It will either be
dropped, or re-constructed, depending on the boolean operation being performed).
