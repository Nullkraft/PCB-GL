Revert "We can just delete kicked out holes"

This reverts commit 6400e974907264b9a0524a0dbdd7dfb9eb623f8b.

We can't (although I'm not 100% sure why).

Basically, deleting a series of polygons which creates a hole
in a certain way causes problems with this commit.
 __________
|    ___   |
|   |___|  |
|__________|

These lines represent line polygons which are deleted one by one
from a larger "world" polygon in the GL version's mask rendering.

The order is such that three of the outer polygons are removed first,
leaving a mirrored C shaped hole in the world polygon:
 __________
           |
           |
 __________|

When subtracing some of the inner polygons, they are erronously
discarded with this patch applied.
