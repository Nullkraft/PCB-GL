Tag VNODEs with details of circular contour segments

The idea here is to track that the PWL segments actually came from a
particular underlying curve. This should allow us to reconstruct that
curve (approximately at least) if these segments survive in the final
polygon (are not intersected or removed by boolean operations).

The convention is that the curve shape tagging of a vertex corresponds
to the edge spanning this, and the net vertex around the list. (As per
other existing edge related flags).

NB: STILL DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY IN ALL CASES. SEE:

(SUSPECTED BUG IN THE GATHER / JUMP ROUTINES)
