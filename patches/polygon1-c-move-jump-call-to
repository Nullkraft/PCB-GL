polygon1.c: Move jump call to bottom of Gather..

We call Gather from Collect1, having in Collect(), established using the j_rule,
that the edge we wish to start with is not marked, and it suitable for inclusion
in the new polygon contour. (Passing what will be the resulting "from" vertex
into Collect1 to start processing).

The first step in Gather was previously a Jump call - which could switch to the
other polygon contour. (Without including our start edge). The key problem here
is that Jump makes the assumption that the vertex it is passed was reached having
been included in the resulting polygon. (It starts inspection of the CVCList from
the assumed entry edge that reached the given vertex).

In our startup condition, the vertex we pass (usually a from vertex, of a FORWARD
polygon traversal of an edge in the 'A' polygon to be included in the resulting
contour), is not necessarily preceeded by an edge on that same source contour that
will end up in the resulting polyon - leading to the possibility that Jump gets
the wrong result. (This is a by-inspection / theoretical issue, not one yet known
to cause any particular bug).

The fix is to include the edge segment we start with, BEFORE calling jump in Collect.
Once our start edge is included, the assumptions made by Jump should hold.
