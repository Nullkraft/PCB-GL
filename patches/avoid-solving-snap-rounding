Avoid solving snap-rounding problem

Always intersect the original line geometry, and hope topology changes caused by
snap-rounding issues don't bite us in our output.


For now - only line-line intersections are enabled, and we still perform multiple
passes through the contours, just as we did before to try and avoid snap-rounding.

Turns out if we enable EPSILONs for node_add_single, we may break adding CVC
records for the "near enough" vertices. (The insert_descriptor() function checks
exact coordinate equality).

If we enable EPSILON for the intersection tests on-line/off-line tests, it causes
problems. (The reason for this is not entirely clear, but likely the current
EPSILON of 1E-6 allows too much offset.)

Lets say 1E-6 * distance of line-segment of say 5,000,000nm (5mm). One EPSILON out
would then be an error of 5nm.
