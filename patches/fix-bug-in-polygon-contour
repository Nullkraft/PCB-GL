XXX: ON REFLECTION, THIS "FIX" IS BOGUS... Fix bug in polygon contour generation

Incorrect contours were emitted in some cases when snap-rounding of vertices to
the integer grid cause coincident shared vertices from the same polygon to meet
at a cross-connected vertex.

The geometry required to create this situation is tricky, but could be provoked
in certain conditions by exactly touching line clearance polygons. (Due to
subtle rounding errors in the clearance polygons don't always meet exactly).

Distilling a simpler test case, the following polygons (on layer A and B)
should be united to reproduce the bug. (NB: The A POLYAREA has two contours
which touch at a single point):

  Layer(1 "A")
  (
    Polygon("")
    (
      [51.0000mm 18.0000mm] [51.0000mm 12.0000mm] [140.0000mm 12.0000mm  ] [144.0000mm 18.0000mm]
    )
    Polygon("")
    (
      [51.0000mm 6.0000mm] [144.0000mm 6.0000mm] [140.0000mm 12.0000mm] [51.0000mm 11.99996mm]
    )
  )
  Layer(2 "B")
  (
    Polygon("clearpoly")
    (
      [139.0000mm 5.0000mm] [145.0000mm 5.0000mm] [145.0000mm 19.0000mm] [139.0000mm 19.0000mm]
    )
  )

In this case the two contours of the 'A' polygon each have an edge that is
horizontal (or very close to horizontal), and meet at a single point inside
the 'B' polygon contour. Due to rounding onto the integer grid, both lines
intersect the B contour at the same point, leaving two coincident edge
fragments belonging to the A contour meeting at that one vertex on the B
contour.

In the above example, operation ordering conspires to insert the two identical
A edges into the CVC list for the common intersection point on the B contour,
in an incorrect order. (They are sorted by pseudo-angles, which are identical
in this case). The reversed order of these paired edges then upsets contour
labeling in node_label().

This commit fixes node_label() to look for and skip pairs of identically angled
edges from the same polygon when iterating around the CVC list. (We can
determine the INSIDE/OUTSIDE status when we find the next, non-paired edge from
the other polygon).
