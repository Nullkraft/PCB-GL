Identify and filter out shared edges within each input polygon after intersecting

Shared-edges can result from snap-rounding during intersection turning distinct
edges with similar slopes into new edges which may share identical portions.

These shared edges then confuse the polygon edge labeling code, which needs to
identify distinct spans of inside / outside each contour. As the edges are
identical, they have ambigous sort-order in the resulting CVCList.
