Fix a degenerate case in tesselation start, plus some fixes and cleanups to squash in

Looks like numerical imprecision as the traced contour wraps around in u,v space
may lead to nearly coincident start/stop events on the u=0 line being sorted out
of the correct topological order.

Skip over them! (NB: It might be possible there are cases with further degenerecies
that this also causes inversion for?)
