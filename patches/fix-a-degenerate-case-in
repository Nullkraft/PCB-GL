Fix a degenerate case in tesselation start, plus some fixes and cleanups to squash in

Looks like numerical imprecision as the traced contour wraps around in u,v space
may lead to nearly coincident start/stop events on the u=0 line being sorted out
of the correct topological order.

Skip over them! (NB: It might be possible there are cases with further degenerecies
that this also causes inversion for?)

Also - some attempts at fixing inverted spherical surface rendering.
PROBABLY WRONG SO FAR...

Need to consider topological winding order of contours which trace entirely within
the u,v region, inside/outside. First attempt computes area - but may get it wrong
for u,v spaces which wrap. Toroids could potentially also be affected, but at the
moment - the attempted fix looks at spherical surfaces.

Need to check that we cope with spherical surfaces bounded by a single contour,
bisecting the surface - perhaps along a line of v=constant? (u-wrap)?

Need to investigate why the tesselation looks ragged for certain facing edges
of a hole cutout within the u,v plane. (See sphere tesselation at top of Neon.step)
