Turn on some debugging for intersections..

Have seen some use-after free corruption in a few places, and this was
aimed at testing whether or not the culprit was performing multiple
intersections on the same segment. (When we perform the deferred work
to split that segment, any later intersections will not point at the
correct seg structure - which has been free'd during the first splitting.
