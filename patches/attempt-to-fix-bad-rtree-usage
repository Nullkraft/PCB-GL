Attempt to fix bad rtree usage in polygon code

We need to delete the rtree entry before updating any bounds, otherwise
bad things might happen (and certainly, with NDEBUG undefined, we may
get asserts firing in rtree.c)

To avoid computational expense deleting and removing from the rtree in
the general case (where we wouldn't expect bounds to change), a new
test function has been added which determines whether the contour bounds
will be updated or not.
