Make sanity checks in MoveLayerToGroup asserts.

The only caller which uses the returned group value was in the Lesstif HID,
but it did not check for the possibility of a -1 return. The -1 return was
made in the case of a precondition failure, having been passed an out-of
bound layer. (Which represents a software bug).

Remove the return -1 in favour of an assert, and introduce a similar assert
checking the validity of the group number - rather than turning the function
into a NOP if an invalid group was passed.

This is a step towards making the layer and group numbers unsigned, as
we cannot return -1 when that is done.
